This project relies heavily [WSPR Live](https://wspr.live) -- a free and publicly accessible database of over 10 billion
WSPR reports. WSPR Live is hosted on [WsprDaemon's](http://wsprdaemon.org) servers.

WSPR TV's UI is powered by the excellent [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) mapping library and the snappy
[uPlot](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot) charts.
